\section{Job Experiences}
\subsection{Freelance}
\cvline{}{I've been working with web technologies since 2009. My first real commitment has been in 2010, when I developed a web application for a data processing center. Features included were invoices management, delivery notes and reporting on charts.}

\subsection{Startup}
\cvline{}{During university I was enthralled by startups, the idea of making something fresh and innovative. The first try was a 2-men web application: Blackstilt. The project was about social aggregation, built to inform the user about major facts discussed on the Internet but without the need of any authentication.}

\cvline{}{The second try was G2GFormation, a community of ``geeks'' with the goal of spreading low-cost IT knowledge between a teacher, the ``geek'', and his students, the ``followers''. I partecipated as geek two times, talking about \LaTeX\ and Django.}

\subsection{Web developer}
\cvline{}{Between 2011 and 2012 I worked as a web developer for a no-profit organization named ``Fondazione Progetto Ematologia'', in Vicenza. We finally deployed RedCap, an open source platform with the goal of managing medical and statistical datasets with particular focus on security and usability.}

\subsection{IT consultant}
\cvline{}{In 2013 I was hired in KPMG. Today I'm an IT consultant that spends most of his time for a market leading insurance company. While my technical skills are still very important for the everyday job, it's being critical to work in strict contact with my business representatives, maximizing the quality of the teamwork and delivering the best possible service to the customer.}

\section{Areas of interest}
\cvline{}{\small Sport: archery, swimming, fitness}
\cvline{}{\small Music: hard rock with electric guitar, classic music with piano}
