\section{Job Experiences}
\subsection{Freelance}
\cvline{}{I've been working with web technologies since 2009. My first real commitment has been in 2010, when I developed a web application for a data processing center. Features included were invoices management, delivery notes and reporting on charts.}

\subsection{Startup}
\cvline{}{During university I was enthralled by startups and the idea of making something fresh and innovative. My first project was a social aggregation web application, built to inform the user about the most popular facts that were viral on the Internet.}

\cvline{}{I partecipated at 2 public talks in front of a young IT community talking about \LaTeX\ and Django.}

\subsection{Web developer}
\cvline{}{Between 2011 and 2012 I worked as a web developer for a no-profit organization named ``Fondazione Progetto Ematologia'', in Vicenza. We deployed RedCap, an open source platform for the managing of medical and statistical datasets with particular focus on security and usability for the medical staff.}

\subsection{Management consultant}
\cvline{}{In 2013 I was hired in KPMG as a SAP functional and technical analyst. I have maturated a 6 years experience in the KPMG team in charge of the maintenance and evolution of the Insurance Accounting FS-CD platform in Assicurazioni Generali, one of the market's most sophisticated and complex implementations in Europe. This quite long experience in a relevant and international insurance group made me able to gain wide skills on the industrial and general accounting processes, on accounting rules in a multi-GAAP context and on connections with underlying business areas and related Solvency II and IFRS 17 compliance constraints.}

\section{My latest tasks}
