\section{Selected projects}

\subsection{Startup}
\cvline{Freelance}{During university I was enthralled by startups and the idea of making something fresh and innovative. My first project was a social aggregation web application, built to inform the user about the most popular facts that were viral on the Internet.}

\cvline{Freelance}{I partecipated at 2 public talks in front of a young IT community talking about \LaTeX\ and Django.}

\subsection{Project Vita}
\cvline{Fondazione Progetto Ematologia}{Between 2011 and 2012 I worked as a web developer for a no-profit organization named ``Fondazione Progetto Ematologia'', in Vicenza. We deployed RedCap, an open source platform for the managing of medical and statistical datasets with particular focus on security and usability for the medical staff.}

\subsection{Management consulting}
\cvline{KPMG}{In 2013 I was hired in KPMG as a SAP functional and technical analyst. I have maturated a 7 years experience in the Advisory team in charge of the evolutionary maintenance of the technical accounting FS-CD platform, for a market leading company in the italian insurance sector. This quite long experience in a relevant and international insurance group made me able to gain wide skills on the industrial and general accounting processes, on accounting rules in a multi-GAAP context and on connections with underlying business areas and related Solvency II and IFRS 17 compliance constraints.}
\cvline{Qintesi}{In 2019 I entered the Qintesi insurance team to deep dive in the IFRS 17 implementation projects. Since then I've been working shoulder to shoulder with expert actuaries and business advisors to design well balanced systems for the reporting of the new internation accounting standard. Until now, the most important challenges have been to find the right balance between the required disclosure and the desidered ease of use for the final user.}
